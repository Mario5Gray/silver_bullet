# Exercises:

```Observe yourself as you go through the day using your reason why not to avoid facing or doing something in various areas of your life-- for example, with your spouse and children. Notice how you use the same excuse for many areas in your life. List all opther areas of your life in which you use your favorite excuse (column 4).```


## Ask yourself: 

```"What am I afraid of?" Let this question drop inside, and sit for several moments with your feelings.  Keep sinking down into your feelings until you FEEL the fear. WHAT IS IT that you are afraid to face?  Put this fear into the 5th column.```
