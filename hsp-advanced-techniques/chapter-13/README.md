* Overview of "Past-life" healing

** Carl Jung Quotes

One does not become enlightnend by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.

** Guardians of the threshold - are the entities that need raising into pure love and light. They are the dark entities you find in one's field that do not do good for them,  That is , they are similar or exactly the same as the entities that Barbara saw as a 'Black Kali' tearing at a patients Seventh level in Chapter 10.

Remember, denial can be a very dangerous force that covers extrerm deep fear.

** Stumbling Blocks the Healer May Encounter in Working with the Fourth Level

*** Projection - it is very easy to project your duality onto what you perceive if you do not understand how the 4thlevel reality world works. When looking through a glass darkly, one sees the darkness projectrd from the self, rather than what it is. One looks for what is, not for waht is wrong. Any fears about the Fourth-level-reality would result in 3 phenomena:

1. The seer's projections from fear will manifest right before the sdeer's eyes

2. The seer's fear which is composed of energy consciousness, draws like energy consciousness to it.

3. The seer demands to be psychic. As in getting frustrated that it's not happening NOW.

* Misuses of fourth-level-reality Phenomena, and how to handle them

** Handling Psychic Attack - This is the proecess called maligning where we unconsciously send negative streamers at a person for some reason. You can just put a protective sheild around the person being maligned.

** Unconscious negative intent in healers is also a form of psychic attack.

1. Not enough training, and making unethical demands on the client.

2. Not enough training in personal psyhchodynamics. and who have little self knowledge about what they are doing and their own underlying motives for some of their actions.
\
3. Undermining , maligning, and proclaiming themselves better than others.

4. Who in a group with only little training proclaimed a person had a lethal disease and that it wa held, therby denying the patient ability to cure self through traditional treatment.  The patient died.

** How to Handle Unconscious Negative Intent:  Make sure client is going to a physician!! Especially if tghe client is ill physically! Always get in touch with the physician!

* Stages of Reactions to the Astral that Must be dealt with in Personal Process Therapy

1. Infatuation - walking into the Astral realm means many new experiences, and as asuch it is possible to forget that unlike our world, the astral world behaves in much different way!  Sometimes this leads to un-positive experiences.  On the other hand, many other people are not open to such concepts as the lower realms. These are indeed scary.

2. Fear - Once some poeple heard and being considering it's existence, then a reaction is fear.  It becomes taboo. Its dangerous and agains some religionts to explore it. Probably this is good, as it takes many years of personal psychological work, and sound grounding in the physical world to attempt it.

3. Terror - Once someone has good experiences such as angels spirits or even aliens, they may not be afraid to enter the fourth level.  Yet sooner or later, when in a bad state of mind or in a dream, the terror comes! This is when the individual realiszes the extend of the fourth-level world and some of its contents. Heavens are OK. But HELLS! No! Or they realize that a person could get lost or caught in the fourth-level  realities especially some who are diagnosed with schizophrenic.

4. Creation of an Acceptable Reality-System.When a student is able to study and work through his fear psychotherapeutically to create a place in his basic reality system to put 4th level reality experiences. By studying the physics of the fourth-level-reality world (ch. 9), and by directly experiencing that fourht-level-reality world does function in the way described, it becomes a place that functions in an understandable way. It is different from the physical, but understandable. The student can succeed by regulating his emotional reactions and breaking the vicious cycle of negative repeated patterns. The student also works on himself to free himself of fear of the unknown.
Of course, everyone does have a cutting edge. The work of brinign back all pieces of the self that are scattered throughout time and space into center and integrating them into one's whole continjues throughout many lifetimes.

* Transference and Projection in Personal Process

It is important to understand transference and projection and their effects on one's experiencce of reality.

** Transference

It is also important to learn to have deep contact with the self. Transference occurs when a person projects the characteristics of a psychologically significant person onto another individual. That authority is said to be "transferred upon".

** Projection

This referes to the psychological phenomenon in which an individual projects his own inner feelings onto someone else, as if the other person was having them rather than himself. A common example of this is being afraid of someone because you are convinced that person is angry with you, when actually you are angry with him. You are feeling fear because of your own anger! Understanding these things, and healing the fear that lies beneath them, one becomes much clearer as to what the true reality actually is!

A lot of personal process work is necessary if one wants to delve into the fourth-level-reality worlds and do healing there. It is muh harder to deal with psychological issues related to the unusual experiences one has in the astral world.

Barbara has discovered thqt there is no limit (probably) to the experiences one can have in the fourth-level-reality worlds. Eventually she grew to learn how to handle encounters with astral beigns, how to communicate with them, and eventually how to help them.

** Misuses of past-life work by the client

3 Major ways a client can misuse past-life work:

1. Avoidance of Issues in this life: The client focuses on other lives to avoid issues in this life. The "other" lives are seen has having been powerful, rich, and/or famous.

2. Projection and Blame: Projection and blame put on people in this klife for things that you experience in other lives. Its as if you have to recieve payback for their behaviour in another lifetime! Focusing on them wont help you to heal. It is your unfinished creationk, not theirs!

3. Unfinished Business doesnt give privileges: Using unfinished business from past-lives to take unwarranted privileges in this life.
