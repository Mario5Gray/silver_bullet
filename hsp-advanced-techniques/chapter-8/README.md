## List of Beigns of the Fourth-Level-Reality World

* Archangels - above fourth-level reality on the higher spiritual levels of the HEF, ABOVE 7. Can go anywhere they like
* Angels - can also travel anywhere they want, as can highly developed human beigns who have reached the level of the bodhisattvas. Many exist at the spiritual levels of the HEF at level 5, 6, and 7 and continue above to the much higher levels of the HEF that BBSH has not written about. Angeles are beigns who have never incarnated. They most naturally follow Goid's will. It would never occur to an angel not to do so. Since they have never incarnated, they never had free will. All the angles have wings. Guardian angels have wings, although it may be the way `I recognize them as angels`. If there is a such a thing as an angel without wings, I would probably put it into a different category, since being raised Christian. This is the way they are supposed to look according to Christianity. Other religions and cultures probably do not necessarliy agree. Thats OK. We are after all, just humans now.
* Guides - guides are beigns that have gone through many incarnations and have reached a level of wholeness that qualifies teaching and guides us along our path of incarnation. They do not have wings, can come in any size, shape, and form, and communicate with us through thought/feeling forms. With HSP, we can see, feel, hear, and touch them. We have several guides: one main guide, then others that come to teach us various things at various times of incarnations.
*Devas - Much like angels, but are in charge of certain aspects of the physical realm, such as attending to the needs of those living in specific spiritual places. there was a deva at the Center for the Living Force; this "deva of the sanctuary" hovered over the center when Barbara lived there. Others are in charge of the specific species.
* Nature spirits - Nature spirits are connectdd with various aspects of nature, such as plants, trees, and flowers
* Other beigns that have never incarneated are difficult to recognize; others that have not incarnated on Earth but perhaps in other physical systems in the universe.
* Discarnate human beigns
* Subpersonalities unintegrated into self
* Discarnate animals, birds, fish, etc.
* Fourth-level-reality beigns in profound separation: Usually on the lower fouth level reality. They look grotesque and try to scare you. Most often as a means of self-protection due to their fear. Since they are in profound separation, they do have som strong negative beliefs and value systems; thus thye also could have a negative intent to harm you because they weill get pleaure by doing it. They have a strong dualistic belific in separation and are afraid of contact. hurting you may be the only type of contact they can handle. sometimes they take the form of little or medium-sized devils. their "devil" appearance depends on hat appearance they believe devils to have according to the culture they lived in their last incarnation.

## Psychonoetic Forms

!! We create these forms and other creative beigns do as well.

From a negative perspecitve, the more we have stewed on or become obsessed with our negative thoughts and emotions, the more clearly defined and powerful the negative forms will be. Their clarity, frequency and intention depend on what ours were when we created them.
