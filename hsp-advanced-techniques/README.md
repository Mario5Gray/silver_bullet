###Advanced HSP Techniques

Things to discover from Chapter 7 of Core Light Healing.

Do a brief review of your childhood experiences to highlight the basdic attitude toward the unknown carried down in your family lineages on both sides. HGere are som good questions to ask yourself:

1. What were the unusual experiences you had at an early age that could not be understood or expained through "normal" reasoning? How did you handle them? What made you curious? What makes you curious now?

2. What were the unspoken attitudes in each of your family lineages about the following?
  a. Realities or the worlds beyond the physical
  b. Personal spirituality in the relationship to organized religion
  c. The nature of evil and its relationship to nonphysical worlds and to HSP
3. How has your attitude to the above and to HSP developed as a result of these experiences?
4. What are your fears about having an experience of the fourth-level world?


###ANSWERS

1. Sightings, Seeing brother form into Mantis-shaped entity at early age 7.
  The dream of a third-eye creature on legs chasing me in a desert landscape at 7. at age 17: walking up the shaft of the great pyramid and climbing into the sky and into space. Feeling and seeing a very bright light as I closed my eyes. Hearing an entity speak to me in Hebrew, Seeing forms in my ordinary furniture as I woke up and became consious.
  The fire at church.
  
  Never really reasoned with it, other than what my friends and family tell me is usual. Otherwise I still remember these experiences clearly today.
  Curious because the dreams seemed so real, and there was a undertone of quality I didnt understand at the time, that same quality exists today maybe I know all along that these are real things outside of our normal perception.

2. No real connection beyond the material world in my family. Mother talks about angels, and is religious. I'm not really sure what to make of it.

3. They were shaped by it.

4. I'd find something I didnt want to discover.
