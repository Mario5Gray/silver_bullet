# The Human Energy Consciousness System (HECS)

Introduction to BBSH observation of the HECS phenomenon. This field, the energies that make up this field is in essence, consciousness.
And because of this important distinction, the addition of the word 'consciousness' to the Human Energy Consciousness Systemhas been incorporated 
throughout BBSH teachings.

Learning to utilize your Creative life process  through the HECS empowers us to understand and to regulate our creativity in order to accomplish our personally chosen life goals while living the life we want. Once we understand the effects of enerby consciousness on our physical reality it can release great powers of creativity within us as we learn new ways of being and doing.

## There are four dimensions of the HECS

The four dimensions of the Human Energy Conwciousness System are:

1. The Core Star

2. The Hara

3. The Human Energy Field

4. The Physical Body

Each dimension (aspects) is distinctly different from the others and functions completely differently.

## 1 - The Core Star

The deepest level of our beign in which the Core Star Exists.  The Source of life within us. At the center is whats is called "The Black Velvet Void". 

### The Black Velvet Void

Is Teeming with in-manifested life. It is full of unimaginable power; and is the source of all manifestation. This undifferentiated life exists within and all around us. It is the foundation of all that is normally called life, on all levels we know, including all four dimensions.

BBSH Stipulates there is a relationship between the Void, and quantum mechanics concept of a zero-point field.  Because the Void and Zero-Point field are sources of all manifestation, it must/may be one and the same.

It is posible through deep meditation to directly experience the black Velvet void within the core star. A key point is that it seems to have all the characteristics of the spiritual "void" referred to by many of the world's sages. BBSH's term for HECS can be considered to include all manifestations of life, material and beyond the material. Including the "void" the level of consciousness of no thoughts and no self.  No thoughts and no self do not exclude the experience of aliveness or awareness!

The core star light is the first manifestation out of the void and into individuality. It appears as a bright point of light that radiates out from us in all directions.

The Core Star is composed as pure light, but not necessarily composed of colors as we normally perceive them. This light is different for each individual living creature on earth. It is the sum total of all that we have become, in our most refined level of beign, through our many experiences in our many incarnations thgrough many millenia. The essence radiated from this place within is unique. It is the distilled essence of all the higher principles that we have imbibed, digested learned and become. It is beyond dimensions, yet it is holographic and appears in the center of each physical cell of our body, in the cell's nucleus, and in our DNA. The Core Star is the opposite of a black hole. It spews out manifest life!

There is no disconnection 
from the void of the core essence
to all else within your life.
The surging of your life force
and its manifestations
comes from this dep apparent emptiness.

You can find this deep, black velvet void 
within the center of every cell,
within every cell's nucleus,
within the DNA,
always surrounded by the
supernova explosion of core essence.

## The Hara

The Core Star Dimension is the basis of The Hara. This is the experience we call intention or purpose. The Hara dimension plays a major role in successfully incarnating - as well as clarifying - one's life purpose and intention to incarnate. The Hara also plays a role in our moment-to-moment intentionality, as you will see later.

when healthy, it extends from about three and one-half to four feet aboue the head all the way down into the center of the earth. At the top is an upside-down funnel where it enters other dimensions that reach toward the Godhead. This point is referred to by BBSH as the Individuation Point (ID point). It represents our first individuation out of the core star dimension into this incarnation, and throuigh it we have our direct connection to the Godhead.

### The Soul Seat

The soul seat is located in the area of the upper chest bone (manubrium) it appears as a soft pulsating light of various pink, lavender, and white colors. This light carries our soul's longing for what we want to accomplish in this lifetime. 

### The Main Power Center - The Tan Tien

A hollow sphere called the Tan Tien is located in the hara about two to three inches below the navel, depending on how tall you are. When healthy, it is a sphere containing the powerful energuy of intention. The Tan Tien has the capacity to hold enormous amounts of power; it becomes filled with power through meditation and exercise.
