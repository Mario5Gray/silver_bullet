# Some Exercises to Sense Your HEF and HECS

1. Try to sense the levels of your HEF. People wh do more physical activities are better at sensing the lower levels first.If you tend to be a feeling person, try to focus on the3 second level. If you hold love above all else, focus on the fourth level first. If you tend to surrender to God's will, then focus  on the fith level first - Which may be the hardest level to sense first. Those who spend a lot of time meditating can sometimes sense the sixth or seventh level more easily. If your meditations focus on feeling bliss or spiritual ecstacy, try to sense the sixth level first. If your meditations focus on stillness and divine mind, try sensing the seventh level first.. Feel, see, hear, know, and sense the level of your field you choose.
