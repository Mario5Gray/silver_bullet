# The HEF of Dying

## QOTD

You are not a slave to three dijmensions nor to the so-called arrow of time, relentlessly moving forward toward your so-called death.
Death is simply a change of form, a letting go to an expansion of beign.

-- Heyoan

It is said that in the East, they pray for a slow death. Perhaps because that gives the person some time to adjust to the process. There is more. Another reason for time to ajust to one's death is what happens in the field at death.

## Experiencial Visitations (experiences from beyond)

### Carol

There Barbara was in her office at the BBSH office in East Hampton, NY. Sitting at her office doing paperwork. The woman named Carol sat behind her. On a normal weekday, Carol's recently deceased mother walked up the stairs and came into the room.  Barbara sensed the relational cords that brought her mom toward her daughter. The mother's intention was to send vital knowledge to Carol through the relational cords. It was the distilled form of knowledge that Carol's mom had learned in this most recent lifetime.

Barbara went on to alert Carol of what is there, and Carol accepted this, went into a state of gratitude. She opened herself to receive what her mother then gave to her. Barbara describes it as clear consciousness flowing through the heart cords from her mother to her heart. Carols mom, then kissed her and left. Even after death, habits are hard to break.

### Barbara's Father

During a workshop prayer, Barbara saw what was her Father hanging to the back of her mother - (she releases him in white light). The next workshop, held shortly after -  during lunch (it was Saturday) Barbara ceceived news over the phone that her Dad had just died. She goes into meditation in order to help if he got stuck. Rather, her father came into the room and proceeded in a determined way to fill her with distilled wisdom he had larned during his life. He asked her to channel in the workshop instead of the normal lecture - because he never seen her channel.

At the workshop, they held hands (tears and all) and began communicating with her deceased father. It was gentle. Then after the workshop/channeling she saw her father come into the room with her aunt Grace - who died several years earlier. Even her grandmother was there (having died since Barbara was 8 years). Then, within the workshop, many ancestors of the participants began filling into the room. Some participants were aware, others were not.

Heyoan told what the deal was: The healing  and reconnecting the cords of relationship, as well as releasing ancestral roots between the re4latives in the physical and in the spiritual realms.

A womon who was there experienced this and became a BBSH student as well.

## How Death Shows In the HEF


### The Silver Cord

Travel in the astral world is actually quite differnt from death. A "silver cord" connects the fourth-level HEF reality and higher spiritual HEF levels to the physical body.
