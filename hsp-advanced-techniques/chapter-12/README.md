* NEGATIVE INTENTION AND THE ASTRAL WORLD

What is called Evil can be seen as extreme duality, which is simply profound forgetting.

** Hexes, Curses, and Entities

Curses & Hexes are similar concepts, and are hard to decipher whether they originally stem from the same meaning. However it is known that they suimply use the laws that function in the fourth-level reality that Barbara has already described. Each culture created their own curses and hexes that they use. They also understand and interpret them according to their own systems.

NOTE: They are extremely dangerious  if cultures deny their existence, because they can cause all sorts of illness, physical pain, fear, strange behaviours, and even death without anyone detecting the cause.

** What is Black Magic and Why Is It So Strong?

Black magic is formed from the willing utilization of fourth-level reality mal-intent and dark energy.  It is the opposite of healing because it's purpose is to harm, control, and inflict dualistic energies at it's target.

Black Magic is encanted over the centuries by secret societies. Objects and symbols may be empowered in this way to carry the dualistic energies and negative intent. Each repition of a ritutal strengthens the negative energy conciousness, power and negative intent in the astral forms and negative worlds that are focused on.

It finds and feeds on terror, and is connected to vast resivours of black negative energy conciousness that have been built up throught the centuries of human existence.

NOTE: One way to maintain power through black magic is to keep it secret.

** Barbaras Experience with Black Magic, Hexes, and Curses

1. Story of lady who was dominated psychically and had a vast matrix of black energy runnig through her chakras. as a result, she needed special attention that Barbara was unable to deal with at the time.  THis was a powerful Problem as it showed through the patient as 'possesion'.

2. Story of non-ethical healing in that a hex/curse was rather transferred to another person! This meant the reciever had very weakend seals and screens and would need much healing. This SHOULD NOT BE PERFORMED.  Hexes/Curses should be dissolved in PURE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

3. A "Curse" from transference. Once, a lady was seeing Barbara, and that lady went to another psychic that told her to send a curse from another lifetime back to Barbara.  This was not necessary, nor possibly even real. It was just a transference which caused a problem of knowng who sent a curse - doesnt mean you have to send it back.  Again just dissolve it with PURE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

Barbara did this by following the dark negative energy streaming tendrils back to the originator, and another individual she didnt know. Then by dissolving them.

4. Curses that last many generations - snakes in the back. dark entities placed hundereds of years ago. These were taken care of by surrounding in pure light / love and moving them through the levels as they evolved into their true/pure form.

** A Basic Overview of Beigns/ Objects and Curses / Hexes in the Fourth Level of the HEF

1. The fourth-level-reality world exists on the same frequence band as the fourth level of the HEF.

2. Objects can be charged with fourth-level-reality energy consciousness to help or to harm. Such objects can transmit this energy consciousness to humans. Some of these objects are called talismans. They are imbued with foruth-level-reality power in ceremonies.

3. Curses/hexes are placed in or on the field by another individual. Such an individual is either trained in or trying to practice some sort of shamanism, whitchcraft, or voodoo.

4. Secret societies that use these powers have existed and still do exist all over the planet.

5. If the person placeing a curse or hex does not have the power to place it inside the field, it simply sits on the field until the cursed individual has an ER. When this happens, thefield weakens enough for the curse to get inside the field.

6. Cusrses/hexes can last for many generations if put ther by a powerful person educated in these things. The power of a curse or hex depencs on the ability of the individual placing it to regulate and control their HEF with focus (reason) and force (will), fueld by emotions.

7. A curse or hex should be dissolved, not sent back, as that is like making a curse on theperson to whome one sends it back.

8. Fourth-level-reality objects stuck in the field are taken to the fifth level of the field, the divine, the template (and form) of all things, to regain their original purpose.

9. Once a fourth-level-reality beign is created, it continues to exist and evolves as a ll beigns do.

10. Fourth-level-reality beigns are taken into the light to regain their normal healthy balanced state.

11. The major tool for fourth-level-reality healing is unconditional lovel. It arises spherically out of the center of the heart chakra when the HEF is clear and balanced. To reach that state, it is good to go to the core star and then the hara level into a state of clear, effortless intention.

12. The use of will force in astral healing usually leads to duality to hurt or to have power over.

13. Don't try to do this on your own. You need to be taught how to handle your fear of the unknown and what is in your subconscious.

14. Your relationship to the fourth-level-reality world is affected by your ancestral past.

15. Your significant relationships, such as in marriage, include the astral past of the families into which you mary.

16. All negative belief systems are conneted to and influenced by fourth-level-reality worlds that hold those beliefs.

17. A complete HEF healing must include astral healing, time capsule healing, and the relational healing, as well as other types of advanced healings, some of which are discussed in this book. A full healing must include at least seven levels of the HEF as well as all aspects of the HECS.

18. The fourth level of the HEF is the level through which all relationships function.

19. The foundation of the fourth level of the field is the heart, the sacred human heart, out of which and through which unconditional love flows.

20 . Remember unconditional love is essential for fourht-level-reality healing.

** Karma

Karma can be seen as an opportunity to resolve any conflict or to clarify
any misunderstandings about reality that you have within you. -- Heyoan

Any unresolved life experience from any life will remain in the field until it is resolved. That's a lot of opportunities in the HEFs of most everyone! Incarnation is an opportunity to clear that so-caled karma away. We keep re-creating the same type of negative experiences in our present life until we resolve it. These re-0creations, although very annoying, do create the opportunity for healing. That is one of the purposes of incarnation.
