# Extreme Duality in the Lower Astral Worlds

* Creating a more understandable framework of certain worlds athat  are considered neither to be real onor to exist by the intellectual community. In our culture, via unspoken law, they are considered to be dangerous and dealt with only through "accepted" religious context, or through psychiatric treatment  that labels them as hallucinations due to psychosis, imagined and projected onto the world outside the self - i.e. not real.

They are the worlds of split conciousness. The beings that inhabit them have profound forgetting of their true selves. They have extremely negative self-judgements adn deep personal pain.

* Choosing sides mean supporting duality
* Choosing sides enhances the split and makes it worse.

## New Way to Enter the Darknes sof the Lower Astral Reality of the HEF

Learn to think holistically, without the tension of opposites. Beigns that created and live in the lower astral territories experience profound forgetting of their wholeness. They are disconnected from their innate goodness that esists deep within the ground of their beign and are therefore in deep pain.

## Recognizing when negative intent is an effor to make contact

Negative entities (so called entities of darkness) are met in the lower astral realities.Keep this in mind to help you maintain your personal connection to your wholeness - you deep inner goodness ,t the foundation of your beign. Because upon entering you will be surrounded and influenced by the dualistic negative energy consciousness that is there. The beigns there will want to draw the same type of duality as theirs from you. This means they will, on purpose, try to bring out the dualistic (the split) in you and enhance it.
We can recognize this extreme negative intent in different way:  It could be the onlyu way they know how to make contact!

The process is normal one: when meeting some new, we want to make contact with someone on common ground of interests. Actually astral being's eeemingly devious maneuvers is that they simply want contact.

Another way to conisder this phenomenon is that beigns caught in the lower astral reality enjoy negative pleaseure, so they will try to get you into it by finding, enhancing, and drawing out the parts of you that enjoy the same type of negative pleasures as they do.

Mission: You have incarnated with them in orer to bring them into wholeness!
Thus in your healing career, when entering the lower astral reality, rather than split into the "easy way out" of calling it hell and the beigns that live ther evil, you will be challenged to face your own negative pleasure and negative intent in order to heal it. This is a must to quality to do astral healing work.

Barbara's example folows: Many years ago, in the middle of the night, lower astral beigns, or so-called dark entities, came to frightne me. Instead, I held on to my faith in the divine worlds, which I had directly experienced, and forced the dark entities to leave with my strong, bright energy conciousness. I, of course, prayed for help. Help came first in the form of the Edgar Cayce meditation group and then the Path-work Center in the Catskill Mountains of New York State, where I lived and worked for yars on my issues. I am forever grateful for that help.

Here is also one of her stories of encountering a so-called evil entity: The story of Bud who committed suicide, and attempted to make 'contact' with Barbara through fear, until she surrendered and gave it non-conditional love and led it into heaven.

Quote: Darkness looking through darkness sees darkness. But if you are in the light, light looking through darkness, you will see what it is.

Profound forgetting is a very deep split in the psyche. A split is a division of the reality into good and bad. In a deep split, bad is really bad(evil) and good is angelic. Unfortunately, an individual with such a deep split tends to identify with the negative side of the split most of the time. When the personality switches to the poitive side of the split, it is usually an exaggerated unrealistic positive that does not last long and is not grounded in physical and spiritual reality. The most common expression of this type of split is expressed in an individual with bipolar syndrome. There is, of course, a physiological aspect of any such split as well as one that shows in the human energy field: the more profound the forgetting, the darker, denser, and more negative the energy. Another way to put it is that a being with a deep split has a very low opinion of itself.

Quote: This great lesson is essential for all those who do astral healing work. It is so easy to look into dark astral worlds and see evil. That is not what the beigns there need! They are already struggling with strong negative self-images. They do not need  others projecting fears onto them. While they may try to frighten you, they do so because they are frightened of you! THey need lighthearted, loving acceptance and recognition of who they are! Beigns on the path eto enlightmentn!

From this learning, Barbara is ready to take on Hell.
