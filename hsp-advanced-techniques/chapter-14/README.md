* Time Capsule Healing: Realeasing the Bonds of the Past

* Heyoan Quotes:

  Once you have gone into that early wond and felt the pain,
  you find there portions of your creative force
  that have een locked inside the wound since it was created.

Thus what you call the past,
locked in a time capsule when that createive force was arreseted,
its not actually a past held in time.

Rather, it is your creative light energy,
held by the wound's density that curls light.

Your illusion of a past is actually your creative energy held in stagnation.

It has not contineud to move and flow
in its normal createive pulse.

Granted, you use the concepts of time
in order to understand what you call memeory.
Yet consider the possibility that memory is a frozen idea of an experience
that has actually been contained in the form aof a capsule,
which we prefer to call a time capsule.

It is simply a stagnated creative energy
that is no longer moving in the creative pulse of life.


** So why arent all aspects of our lives perfect?
 We are unable to create perfect lives because some of your inner reality systems
 are not healthy.  In fact, they are split into seperate parts that are in conflict with
 each other. Usually they are split in half; thus, they are dualistic. We call have unhealthy
 dualistic reality systems that are based on our inner duality.

In other words, and to a certain extend, we assist our freidns in messing up their lives the same way we mess up our own lives!
We dont't conciously know or intend to help create a negative outcome!
We are not aware that the outcome of our advice or actions will be undesirable, both to ourselves and to
the others we advise, thus:

* Quote
 It is important to become aware of
 our unconcious dualistic beliefs,
 our unconscious dualistic energy,
 and our unconscious dualistic intentionality.

Time capsule healing is a technique to find:

1. Our split or dualistic beliefs and their origins.

2. Our split or dualistic intentions that result from these beliefs.

3. How our split or dualistic intentions fight against each other.

4. What unitive outcome we really do want to create.

As long as any createive energy conciousness is associated with a particular creative
endeavor remains dualistic, it will intefere with your ability to complete your creation,
whatever that may be.

The process of time capsule healing returns our dualistic creative energies to their
original holistic state, so that they can complete their original purpose.
Therefore, with time capsule healing, you can re-create your life the way you want it to be!

Question?> Why? Once your holistic energy conciousness re-enters in your Human Energy Consciousness
System, you have much more create energy to heal chronic conditions, change what you want to change, live and
enjoy your life, and create what you long for.


* What are Time Capsules?

Time capsules are conglomerates of unhealed events from the past as well as the current timeline
that have NOT been resolved. They include: physical wounds, emotional irrational behaviour problems, and
dualistic belief systems that are in conflict with each other,  yet at the same time
are drawn together by the principle of "like attracts like."

A major aspect about Past-Life wounds:  (one of seven)

6: Traditionally, they are called past-life traumas.  However in this chapter
we reevaluate that name and move beyond it. Painful experiences in the fourth-level-relaity
world are not organized in linear time.

* IMPORTANT: The non-linearity of time and it's connection to blocks that are now specifically
held in the fourth-level of the Human Energy Field.

Put another way:
Inside a block that is held in the fourth level of the HEF<
time is frozen in the moment that the block occurred. THus the block is seperated
from the normal pulsations of energy flow through the Human Energy Field.
This serparation allows the individual who created the block to function
in daily life, rather than get caught up in his/her deep pain from earlier in life.

Introduction of a 'new type of time' as a tool for healing.  We find this :

Time in the fourth level of the Human Energy Field,
is encapsulated in the experience,
rather than the experience
being encapsulated in time,
as in the physical world.

++ SImilar time capsules are usually groupd and compacted together in a specific area of the
physical body. The longer they are held in the field, the deeper they are compressed into
the field, and more compacted they become. BB sees that they can even be set deep into the
vertical power current, and compacted to the size of a period at the end of a sentence.

** The major Areas where time capsule healing is effective

1 - chronic fears
2 - insecurity
3 - chronic depression / low energy
4 - phobias
5 - Sadomachositci behaviour
6 - guilt
7 - material insecurity
8 - eating disorders
9 - accidents
10 - violence
11 - long term struggles (family)
12 - secual difficulties
13 - negative aggressive sex
14 - harsh marital
15 - chronic physical ailments


* The Process ::

The healing process takes several weeks / months while the Human Energy Conciousness System
re-organizes itself.

** Expect changes in the patient

The healer uses HSP information as a way to be more present with the client. The healer does not
disclose HSP information to the client until after the healing and after the
client talks about the experience (if the client chooses).
The healer thane shares HSP information in a way that confirms the client's experience, or in some cases
gives more information that the client obtained to help the lcient more deply understand the healing
that he took part in by being willing to experience the pas in order to heal it.

Energy flow techniques:  Push, Pull, Stop, Allow, and Neutral .

Learn how to completely stop the flow of energy and also to just allow it to flow naturally (out the hands).

**
** The Healers regulation of energy coming out her hands:
Learn to direct it, learn to pull harmful energy out with the hands. Learn to stop, clean, and release
the harmful energy into the light before it gets stuck in the wrists or arms!!!!!!!

During healing, the HEF naturally pulsates through it's four-phase cycle of expansion, stasis, contraction,
and statis. During a healing, the hearler is always aware of what phase that four-phase cycle
pulse is in, and regulates the healing accordingly. Also called "Follow the Wave". Frequence matching
is done in neutral mode and is very effective.

Healing techniques:
* Chelation.

The stagnated energy id dark,
dense, low energy, and dualistic.

The creative energy is clear,
holistic, vibrant, alive, and healing.

Once the creative energy consciousness is strong enough,
the original creative intention can be fulfilled!

** Healers must reamin present!
Beginning healers must learn to remean present during the full healing in order to support the client.
If a client gets scared, she may withdraw her presecne tof support. This will undermine the healing, and
the client will experiecne being abandonded during a time of need. This will then abort the healing
process, and the healer must start again at the beginninng - if the client is willing, and if
the healer is ready.

Closure must be ensured if the client wished to stop. Recommended to schedule another healing session
if this happens.

* QUOTE: 
It is the responsability of the healer
to remain clear and maintain integrity.

The energy consciousness
that is released during a healing
is the same age it was
when the wound was created.
Since then, it has bee
held in suspended animation!
For example, if a wound happened
when you were five years old,
that is the age of the newly released
energy consciousness!

It needs a few weeks to 'grow up',
to become integrated within the client at his present age.


** Important points about the many-lives theory of human existence and time capsule healing

Avoiding our wounds is maintaining the duality that is held there. This simply leads to the
creation of more duality, which causes more confusion, pain, suffering,low energy, blocked
creativity, and wounding. We create entire lifesystels around our enexplained fears held
in our time capsules.

Releasing our creative process requires that we go inside our wounds to complete the
experience that we stopped. By being present in it - i.e., by feeling our emotions
and allowing our thoughts that are locked inside to flow - we bring those two
aspects of ourselves that were split from each other back together.
In doing so, we free that creativbe energy consciousness, which then continues on its original creative
wave to its completeion.

This is how we re-create our lives the way we long for them to be.

Rahter than consider karma as punishment for our "sins" it can be seend first as simly the reaction
from our past creations. Taken a step further into understanding the implications of time capsules,
karma can simply be the dualistic / unsatisfactory creations we continue to make because we have not yet
brought the duality in our time capsules into wholeness, so they are still not part of our healthy creative process.
Since they are still held in duality, they are still creating dualistically, thus the products of their creations are dualistic, not holistic, and therefore unhealthy and split into "good" and "bad".

** Why Time Capsule Healing is Better Than Past-Life Healing

Blaming our troubles on someone else's actions toward us, whether in this lifetime or a different
one, doesn't help us because it appears to give them power over our lives.
Actually this is impossible, but when we act as if it were true, we remain victimes. Why?
Because we dont understand the process that have been described above. Time capsule healing
changes all this. It releases the blame we put on other s for our state of inadequacy.
Our problems that may have been initaited in relationship in another person do not
depend on that other person.

Our problems, oru wounds, are held in place by ourselved! they are held in our unfinished experiences
inside our wounds. They are held in the duality maintained in our wounds. Our healing
depends on bringing our inner duality together into wholeness, to regenerate our original creative endeavor
that then joins our creative pulse of life. Once we have accomplished this,
we have released our creative processes that will complete our original creative desires.

This creation is what we have longed for our entire lives. It is our responsability to focus on and complete
our unfinished experiences that are sitll locked inside our wounds.
This is what causes our problems in creating our lives, and not tha tosmeone somewhere in our
close or distant past that ahs done something dreadful to us!

** Quote:

In this process we fulfill our longigs,
build our lives, and in doing so,
compete ourselves!
Understanding and living this gives us great freedom!

Welcome to your new life!


* Review:

1 Reinterpret yoru partuicualr wounds and past-life experiences as time capsules. Give yourself
time to write about this experience in your journal.

2 List the major time capsules in your field thjat need healing, and their original intent for creation.

3. What basic duality is held in the time capsule that prevents your creation
from coming to fruition? This duality will most likely blame the other person.
Under it lies a fear you had about your ability to creat what your wanted.
This prevented you from moving ahead with your creation. How can you do this now in your life?
What form would it take? (It could be the same form, it could be a different one. There is always an
opportunity waiting.
